## Testing & Best Practices
- **Manual testing:** Use `npm run dev` and interact with the UI in your browser.
- **Linting:** Always run `npm run lint` before pushing changes.
- **Component isolation:** All major UI pieces are in `src/components/` and should be reusable.
- **Theme:** Use CSS variables from `globals.css` for all colors, backgrounds, and text for dark/light compatibility.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use the `.glass` class for Apple-like frosted surfaces.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all text has sufficient contrast in both dark and light mode.
- **Responsive:** Layouts use CSS grid/flex and should work on all screen sizes.
